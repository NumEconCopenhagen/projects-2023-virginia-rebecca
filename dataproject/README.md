# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **CO2 EMISSIONS AND INCOME PER CAPITA** and is about the relationship between economic growth and the environment. A popular hypothesis in the literature regards the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC), according to which economic growth harms the environment only up to a certain level of income per capita, after which the effects of economic growth are beneficial for it (Stern, 2017). Since the appearance of the hypothesis there has been a huge debate about it. Considering this framework, in this project we want to explore data about income per capita and the environment.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets** from the website of the World Bank:

1. GDP per capita (in current US$) 
2. GDP per capita PPP (in current international $)
3. CO2 emissions (in metric tons per capita)

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

`pip install pandas-datareader`
`pip install git+https://github.com/elben10/pydst`
