# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **THE KRUGMAN MODEL OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE** and is about Krugman's paper of 1979. The model is based of monopolistic competition. It allows to understand why also similar countries trade: because of economies of scale. Two equilibrium conditions are the key to solve the model: the optimal pricing rule in monopoly for the firms, that is a short run condition, and the zero profit condition, that concerns the long-run when the entry of more firms attracted by positive profits brings the economy in a situation of perfect competition.  

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb). It uses a class for the model which is in the file krugmanclass.py.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
