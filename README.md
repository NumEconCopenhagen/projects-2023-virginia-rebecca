This repository contains  
1. Inaugural project. 
2. Data project: **CO2 EMISSIONS AND INCOME PER CAPITA** . We fetch data from the website of the World Bank (GDP per capita (in current US$), GDP per capita PPP (in current international $) and CO2 emissions (in metric tons per capita)) to show the relationship between some economic growht variables and the environment. 
3. Model project: **THE KRUGMAN MODEL OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE**. We solve the model, we see how the equilibrium changes when countries open to trade and we extend the model adding taxes.
