This repository contains  
1. Inaugural project. 
2. Data project: **CO2 EMISSIONS AND INCOME PER CAPITA** . We fetch data from the World Bank website (GDP per capita (in current US$), GDP per capita PPP (in current international $) and CO2 emissions (in metric tons per capita)) to show the relationship between some economic growht variables and the environment. 
3. Model project: **THE KRUGMAN MODEL OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE**. We solve the model, and we see how the equilibrium changes when countries open up to trade. Then we provide an extension of this model adding taxes.
